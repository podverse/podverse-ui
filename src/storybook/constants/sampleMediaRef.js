  title: 'Matt Mullenweg, the creator of Wordpress, on the four freedoms of the GPL open source software license',
  episodeDescription: `<p>I have a rule. After every podcast, I write down 10 things I learned. I don't know if anyone else does this. Do you do this? Some people make illustrations. They send me what they've learned. It's a creation of a creation of a creation. A drawing of a podcast of someone's life.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I broke my rule. It's been over a month. And my brain is digging for the lessons from my interview with the creator of Wordpress. I think I have Alzheimer’s. Matt was 19 years old when he started Wordpress. It was 2003. Now Wordpress.com </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">gets more traffic than</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">Amazon.com</span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times both use Wordpress. I use Wordpress.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to know if it’s still worth the time and effort to make your own site. He said it is. That’s how you break out...</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We're trying to revitalize the independent web,” Matt Mullenweg said. He’s 33 now. "It's not like these big sites are going anywhere. They're fantastic. I use all of them, but you want balance. You need your own site that belongs to you... like your own home on the Internet."</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is part of Matt’s code. Not Wordpress’s “code.” Matt’s like a robot. I mean that as a compliment. There are many signs of this: language, ability, he’s very exact.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to interrupt. He was talking in code. And it was my job to translate.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said, "If I send you a unit of work...”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I don't mean to interrupt,” I said. “I'm a little bit of an interrupter. So I apologize in advance, but you talk in a very code-like language…</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">'a unit of work.’</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">How about ‘a task?’ That works as well."</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He laughed. And thanked me for translating. The podcast continued.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told me about his personal code (again, robot).</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People have values. Geniuses and other advanced forms of life  have “code.” So here’s Matt’s...</span></p> <p> A) Measure what’s important to you.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt wrote a birthday blog. He does this every year to measure what’s changed. It lists how many books he’s read over the past year, countries he traveled to and so on.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s very specific.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a measurement of his personal freedom. He can see where time went. And if he chose himself. “You cannot change what you don’t measure,” Matt said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this year,</span> I wrote a birthday blog<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> <p><strong> B) Own the work you do</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Other sites provide space,” he said. “They provide distribution in exchange for owning all of your stuff. You can't leave Facebook or Twitter and take all of your followers with you."</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why he recommends having your own website. It’s yours. Not Facebook’s. Not Business Insider’s or Huffington Post’s. It’s yours.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I first started jamesaltucher.com, I picked a template, posted a blog, shared a link on Twitter and within 3-4 minutes I had traffic.</span></p> <p> C) Ignore concern</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt dropped out of college and moved to San Francisco when he was 20.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Were your parents upset?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’ve always been supportive,” he said. “But they were concerned.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That didn’t stop him. He had direction. And when you know where you’re going, you don’t ask for directions.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes I feel like I’m driving with the wrong address in my GPS. And Siri won’t stop re-routing.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what I learned from Matt: Reroute yourself as many times as it takes. Reinvent.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put someone else’s concern for your wellbeing on your gratitude list. But don’t let it stop you. Don’t let it get in the way of your code.</span></p> <p> D) The myth of loyalty</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Matt moved and started his first job, he made more than his dad did.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I got an amazing salary,” he said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I kept wondering if his parents were upset. I don’t know why.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Were they upset?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said no. Again. But then he explained. “Learning spreads organically.” And when he moved, it helped spark possibility for his dad.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He worked at the same company for 26 or 27 years. He more than doubled his salary when he left. It made me so sad. I never want anyone to be in the situation my dad was in,” he said. “He gave the loyalty of decades and they didn’t return that loyalty…”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? Because they were following a different code. The “employee code” is not the same as the “employer code.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t measure much. I try to let my life float by. And I hope to help people feel free enough to live by their own codes too. Like Matt and his dad.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s how I measure what’s important to me. Am I supportive? Of myself and of others? If yes, then I’m a mix of creation and evolution. Robot and human.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code and DNA.</span></p> <p><br /> <br /></p>`,

He has the solution to my problem…<br /><br />And maybe your problem, too.<br /><br />Adam is the youngest tenured and highest-ranking professor at the famed business university The Wharton School, a writer for The New York Times, and the New York Times bestselling author of Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success.<br /><br />In researching his new book, Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World, Adam met with today's most successful and innovative entrepreneurs. <br /><br />Why? To get answers.<br /><br />“We have a ton of guidance on how to generate ideas,” he says. But what about after? What do you do?<br /><br />Originals teaches you how to bring new ideas into the world.<br /><br />And really, there’s no grand theory on how to be "original."

From Larry Page and the Warby Parker guys, he found a common thread. Hint: don’t quit your day job. But, more on that later.<br /><br />I’m going to tell you the top three things to be “an original.” They might surprise you. But first, I want you to know what else you’ll get from today’s podcast:<br /><br /><br /><br />How to get into a flow state (even during tasks you don’t like) [51:32] <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Should you plan your procrastination?

The top three things to become "an original:"<br /><br />1) Induce creativity<br /><br />First unlearn. Then learn...<br /><br />We’ve all internalized things we need to question.<br /><br />That’s what adults do. We make up rules and reasons. We draw lines instead of pictures… tell “facts,” not stories.<br /><br />But why can’t we play with our food? Or stand on the counter?<br /><br />Kids think. Kids create.<br /><br />And we can get back to that too.<br /><br />We just have to unlearn. And then re-learn.<br /><br />“This comes back to our idea of broadening your experience and your knowledge,” Adam says. “You need to step outside of your field in order to see what you should be challenging.”<br /><br />Immerse yourself in new domains. Go beyond work… beyond your office… beyond the usual.<br /><br />Personally, I dabble in a lot of things. I play games. I write. I read. I'm involved in lots of businesses. And I recently tried stand-up comedy.<br /><br />“I've just pursued things I'm curious about,” Adam says, “and then unexpectedly, they turn out to have bridges between them.”<br /><br />That’s the key to learning. Do something new. Do a dare of the day. It’s good for your creative health. <br /><br />2) Don’t quit your day job (yet).<br /><br />Give yourself time to build your business. It worked for me. I tell why in this episode. Listen at [21:31].<br /><br />And be conservative. It’s one of the best ways to be original.<br /><br />“I was stunned actually,” Adam says. He read this a “nationally represented study of American entrepreneurs.” “People who did what you did, James, and kept their day job are 33% less likely to fail.”<br /><br />3) Propel your ideas forward<br /><br />Doubting your ideas can be paralyzing, so eliminate self-doubt. According to Adam, a lot of originals said, “Look, you could fail by starting a business that flops or you could fail by not starting a business at all, and I don't want to be in that second category."  Listen at [22:09] to get actionable steps to fight self-doubt.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Listen now.<br /><br />And let’s stop being afraid...<br /><br />Together.<br /><br />Resources and Links:<br /><br /><br /><br />Read Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World by Adam Grant <br /><br />Listen to my last interview with Adam Grant here <br /><br />Read Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success by Adam Grant <br /><br />Follow Adam on Facebook, Twitter, & visit his website www.adamgrant.net to read his articles.`,

  title: `"Money is probably the most successful story ever told, because it's the only story everybody believes."`,
  episodeDescription: `<p>My ancestor from 70,000 years ago was smarter than me. He knew every plant, mushroom, animal, predator, prey in a several mile radius.</p> <p>He knew how to make weapons. He knew how to capture something, make it edible. I can barely order delivery. And as far as weapons, they say “the pen is mightier than the sword” but I don’t think a tweet is.</p> <p>My ancestor also knew how to adapt to new terrains, how to handle strangers who could be threats, how to learn who to trust and who not to trust. I wish I had his skills.</p> <p>Not only that. Archaeological evidence says his brain was bigger than mine. And bigger is better.</p> <p>To make things worse, another animal made the entire human race its slave. Wheat domesticated us. It forced us to stick around for the harvest, horde up for years when the harvest might be bad, go from a life of a diverse diet to basically all carbs all the time. And it turned us from hunters to farmers.</p> <p>But it’s not all bad. And the news is actually very good. Probably the books I’ve recommended most in the past five years was “Sapiens” by Yuval Harari. And not only me: it’s Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg’s top recommendation.</p> <p>And now Yuval has a new book, “Homo Deus” – i.e. where are humans heading? If Sapiens explored the last 70,000 years of human history, “Homo Deus” takes the trends into the future. What will happen next?</p> <p>The answers are fascinating. And I had even more questions. I couldn’t believe I was finally talking to Yuval after reading “Sapiens” so many times and recommending it on every list and giving the book to all of my friends. And then finally reading “Homo Deus“.</p> <p>What made humans the only animal to spread across the entire globe? What was special about us? How did we go hundreds of miles into empty water to find Australia for instance? I would never take that risk! And then survive and flourish in a completely new ecosystem, just like we did in North America.</p> <p>“Fiction,” Yuval told me, and describes in his book. “We created elaborate fictions for ourselves: ‘nations’, ‘corporations’, ‘religion’, ‘crusades’, and perhaps the most successful fiction: ‘money’. So I could use a dollar and some stranger in China can use a dollar and we can trust each other enough to do a transaction.”</p> <p>So what’s next? “Homo sapiens are going to evolve again.” Yuval said, “Technology is taking us there and technology is evolving much faster than we are.”</p> <p>I still can’t believe I spoke to him. Five years ago I took his course on Coursera. I was thinking, “how did this guy get so smart?” And now I was talking to him.</p> <p>And, like I said, the news was not bad.</p> <p>Here’s what I learned:</p> <p>1. The economy needs you to invest in yourself</p> <p>“There’s a change in the nature of the economy from a material based economy to a knowledge-based economy. The main assets in the past were material like gold minds or wheat fields,” Yuval said. “These are the types of things you can conquer through violence.”</p> <p>That’s how we got California. The US invaded and absorbed their wealth. But you can’t invade and absorb knowledge.</p> <p>China isn’t going to take over Silicon Valley and absorb all the wealth. “Today, the main asset is knowledge,” he said.</p> <p>The only good investment you can make for your future is the investment you make in yourself today.</p> <p>Hone your idea muscle, build a network and a library of mentors, make a commitment to do one healthy thing a day. Because the health of your body impacts the health of your brain.</p> <p>I try to improve 1% a day. That’s it. That’s how I invest in myself.</p> <p>2. Explore Internal realities vs. External realities</p> <p>Resources today are different. They’re abstract.</p> <p>Yuval said, “The source of wealth in California today is knowledge, in the mind’s of engineers and technicians and CEOs. And you just cannot conquer it by force.”</p> <p>That’s one of the reason’s why Yuval says, “You see a decline in international violence.”</p> <p>The other reason: weapons are too powerful.</p> <p>“Nuclear weapons have transformed war between superpowers,” he said. War today is “collective suicide, which is why we don’t have such wars since 1945.”</p> <p>Terrorism is different. Their weapon is fear. Yuval calls it “psychological menace.” But he’s really concerned about them in our future.</p> <p>“Terrorists function by capturing our imagination, turning our imagination against us, and causing us to overreact,” he said.</p> <p>“In a way, a terrorist is like a fly that tries to destroy a china shop. The fly is so small and weak. It cannot move even a single teacup. So how does a fly destroy a china shop? The fly finds a bull, gets into the ear of the bull and starts buzzing. The bull becomes so enraged that it loses its temper and destroys the china shop. This is what happened in the middle east over the last 15 years,” Yuval said.</p> <p>“Al-Qaeda could never destroy Iraq by itself. It got into the ear of the United States and the United States went wild and destroyed the middle eastern china shop for Al-Qaeda. This is how terrorism functions. And if you want to fight terrorism you should start with your own imagination.”</p> <p>For me, this means understanding that ideas are currency. Becoming an idea machine, writing ten ideas a day, so you get the new ‘weapons’ of Sapiens, is the key.</p> <p>3. We’re going from “humanists” to “data-ists”</p> <p>In 500 years we might not be dealing with humans at all.</p> <p>Look at Amazon for example. They tell us what to buy. We don’t ask our friends. We ask data.</p> <p>“Given the advances of bioengineering, brain-computer interfaces and so forth, I think it’s very likely that within a century or two homo sapiens will disappear and be replaced by a completely different kind of being,” Yuval said.</p> <p>He says bioengineering is just one possibility. Another is we start connecting brains and computers to create cyborgs.</p> <p>This isn’t science fiction. It’s already happening.</p> <p>I’m sort of scared and sort of excited. We went from tribes to villages to cities to kingdoms to empires to “isms” to…data that will unite us.</p> <p>The next step in our evolution. The final frontier.</p>`,
